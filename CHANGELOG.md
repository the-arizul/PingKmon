# PingKmon Changelog

## v2.0.6 - Zero-Lag Canvas Decimation & Offline Launch (2026-10-16)

### 🚀 Major Highlights
- **Zero-Lag Canvas Decimation Engine**: Implemented Min-Max bucket aggregation and adaptive coordinate mapping in `PingCanvasChart.tsx` and `TimelineCanvasChart.tsx`. Decimates arbitrary sample counts down to screen pixels, eliminating all render lag and frame drops during extended monitoring.
- **Unlimited Continuous Network History**: Removed the 5-minute data restriction across timeline and detail views. Extended local and memory retention to 24 hours (86,400 samples/host) without memory or rendering bottlenecks.
- **Offline Launch Resilience**: Optimized WebView2 Google Fonts loader in `index.html` to load non-blocking with local system fallbacks, enabling instant offline app launch without internet connection stalls.
- **Single-Pass Rendering & O(log N) Inspection**: Cached canvas gradients outside render loops, merged sub-pixel packet-loss bars, and converted crosshair/hover detection to binary search.

## v2.0.4 - Nearest Speed Test Engine & Single Monitor Performance (2026-09-02)

### 🚀 Major Highlights
- **Nearest-Server Auto Selection Engine**: Rewrote speed test auto-resolver logic in Rust (`lib.rs`) to measure latency across regional endpoints first, filter candidates within 15ms of lowest ping, and select the highest throughput server among nearest candidates.
- **Single Monitor Chart Performance Fix**: Fixed scrolling lag and high-frequency render bottleneck in `TargetDetailView.tsx` by replacing `Intl` locale string formatting with zero-allocation lazy getters.
- **Continuous Chart Render Loop & Enhanced Zoom**: Eliminated render stalls during live monitoring and increased graph zoom ratio to 12% default.
- **Expanded RAW Speed Test Registry**: Added 18 verified high-performance HTTPS endpoints across South Asia (Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai), Southeast Asia (Singapore), East Asia (Tokyo), Europe, Australia, and the Americas, including official OpenSpeedTest nodes.
- **Auto-Resolved Target Persistence**: Fixed UI state lifecycle in `SpeedTest.tsx` to retain auto-resolved nearest targets without defaulting back to the first list item.

## v2.0.3 - Automatic Update Management & Graph Controls (2026-09-02)

### 🚀 Major Highlights
- **Automated Startup Update Checker**: Implemented a 3-tier fallback update checking mechanism in Rust (`reqwest` with custom `User-Agent` + raw Fastly CDN fallback + GitHub Web release redirect) that bypasses unauthenticated API 403 rate limits.
- **Standout Update Indicators**: Added glowing, high-contrast action badges in the top navigation header and the **About** modal dialog when an update is available.
- **Interactive Graph Positioning**: Added a uniform **Back to Live** action button in the Target Detail view whenever the graph domain is panned, zoomed, or customized.
- **Preset Target Protections**: Built-in default host targets (*Cloudflare DNS, Google Primary, Quad9, OpenDNS, Local Gateway*) are strictly protected against accidental edits or deletion.
- **Rich Markdown Changelog Decoding**: Native Markdown parser inside the Update Dialog supporting headers, bullet lists, code blocks, bold text, and hyperlinks.

### 🛠️ Diagnostics & Core Architecture
- **Sub-Second ICMP Probing**: Async WinAPI `iphlpapi` ICMP sweep engine with sub-second sample rates.
- **Memory Footprint Optimization**: Automatic background memory trimming and GC optimizations to preserve minimal RAM usage during extended monitoring sessions.
- **Dual Repository Synchronization**: Automatic synchronization between the proprietary source repository (`PingKmon-Code`) and the public asset/release repository (`PingKmon`).
