### Chocolatey
```powershell
choco install pingkmon
```

---

## Overview

PingKmon is an ultra-fast, high-performance network diagnostic and latency monitoring tool built specifically for Windows powered by **Tauri 2.0** and a **native Rust ICMP engine**. Whether diagnosing packet loss spikes, troubleshooting routing bottlenecks, or verifying connection stability, PingKmon delivers real-time telemetry with an extremely low system resource footprint (**~15-30 MB RAM**, **< 0.5% CPU**).

---

## Key Features

* **Native Rust ICMP Engine**  
  Direct Windows `iphlpapi.dll` socket execution delivering true native ICMP pinging with sub-millisecond precision and zero simulated data.

* **Multi-Host Concurrent Monitoring**  
  Track latency, jitter, and packet loss across multiple servers, DNS endpoints, and local gateways simultaneously in real time.

* **PingPlotter-Style Loss & Gap Visualization**  
  Full-height red vertical loss indicators that highlight packet drops clearly without compressing latency curves, plus shaded gray gap blocks for sleep/disconnect periods.

* **High-Frequency Visual Timelines**  
  Smooth interactive HTML5 canvas charts with monotone spline interpolation and configurable sampling rates (`0.2s`, `0.5s`, `1s`, `2s`, `5s`).

* **Visual Traceroute and Path Diagnostics**  
  Hop-by-hop route analysis identifying peering bottlenecks, ISP routing issues, and intermediate node packet drops.

* **Integrated Multi-Server Speed Test**  
  Multi-threaded Tokio HTTP throughput tester measuring download speed, upload speed, bufferbloat, and loaded latency directly inside the app.

* **Per-Host Acoustic & Threshold Alarms**  
  Configurable audio synthesizer alerts and visual banners triggered when latency exceeds custom thresholds or connection outages occur.

* **Native Windows & Tray Integration**  
  System tray background minimization, configurable auto-start on Windows boot, and automatic background memory trimming.
