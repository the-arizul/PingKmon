# Privacy Policy for PingKmon

Last updated: September 1, 2026

PingKmon is designed with a strict **privacy-first** architecture. We believe that diagnostic network software should serve the user without silently collecting private information.

---

## 1. Zero Personal Data Collection
* PingKmon does **not** collect, store, or sell any personal data, names, email addresses, IP history, or passwords.
* PingKmon does **not** inject telemetry trackers, third-party analytics SDKs, or targeted advertising trackers.

## 2. Local-Only Processing
* All ICMP ping statistics, packet loss calculations, jitter measurements, traceroute hop histories, and audio settings are processed and stored **100% locally on your machine**.
* Your diagnostic logs and target host configurations remain solely on your local storage.

## 3. Network Communications
PingKmon performs network communications strictly to fulfill user-initiated operations:
1. **Network ICMP / Socket Pings:** Sends standard ICMP echo requests to the hostnames or IP addresses explicitly configured by the user.
2. **Speed Test:** Measures bandwidth and latency against user-selected public speed test endpoints.
3. **Application Updates:** Queries the official GitHub API (`api.github.com`) to check if a new application release is available. No user identification or hardware data is transmitted during update checks.

## 4. Third-Party Services
PingKmon does not share data with any third-party marketing or analytics services.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please open an inquiry on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/the-arizul/PingKmon/issues).
